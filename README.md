# WarehouseForge_WarehouseForge
WarehouseForge is a modern ELT data engineering pipeline that loads raw data into Snowflake, transforms it using dbt with built-in data quality tests, and orchestrates workflows with Apache Airflow. The project demonstrates warehouse-first design, analytics engineering best practices, and production-style orchestration.
